# ðŸŒŒ Milky Way
## A lightspeed way to start a modern stack React and Vite project, with a bundle of modern tools

> Getting to the edge of the milky way takes time, so use this spaceship that travels at the speed of light

### Motivation

- Every time we start a project, we run a series of commands, like a command to create an initial structure, then to install some tools like Tailwind, Jest or Vitest, or to install an Axios, or other libraries. After that, we started to create a series of basic components, configure notification system, theme provider, application context to manage state, static routing system, some utility hooks, among many other things we do.
- It was thinking about saving time, and focusing on solving ideas that I created this template. Because we know that when we have an idea, we spend 3 to 6 hours configuring the base of a project until it is at least usable, we end up losing focus on what we were going to create, losing a series of useful ideas.
- So, I'm delivering a solid foundation with a minimal structure ready, so you don't get lost thinking about how to structure your project, or what features you need to implement, or how you're going to implement things. Everything you find here has been built on years of experience with Frontend, plus a lot of experience gained from creating frontend projects that are in production and have been successful, scalable and easy to maintain.
